# Usefull Commands
In this file useful commands are explained. This exercise should train the basic tasks with git.

## git config
Is used to configurate the personal data in git. Such as the mail adress, name, branch and the pull command. `git config` is usually followed by `--global` which indicates that the changes are made for the whole git program. Usually this command is used once or if some of the data changes.

## git init
This command is used to introduce git with the directory it should manage. Therefore you have to open the prefered directory in the terminal and use this command. Git will create a hidden directory. This command is used one time when you introduce the directory to git.

## git clone (additional)
The directory which should be cloned is not only copied, but the complete repository including all commits, branches and tags are cloned. It also sets up which directory it is descending. This command is used once or when you want to clone your repo.

## git commit
Carries out the storing of the staged files. This command is used everytime you want to flush your files from the staging area into the git repo.

## git status
Shows which files or directories are not tracked by git. Before the **.gitignore** file it said that the `hmtl`and `pdf`file were not tracked. After that it did not show it.

## git add
Adds the given files to the so called staging area. This area includes all changed files which will be stored in the git database once you enter `git commit`. Everytime a change was made in a file, you have to add it to the staging area.
