# Benefits of Unit Testing

- Unit tests are useful to detect errors in your own code. If you know what the output should be, you can make a method
which tests this.
- Test driven development: With this method to implement code, you are able to implement the test first, and after that
you implement the method itself.
- Unit tests can help you detect bugs or errors. For example, if you add a new feature and your program was working 
before, but suddenly after the feature was added the program has some bugs. With unit tests you are able to target 
the bug easier.
- Unit tests ensure (if done correctly) that your methods are working correctly!

# Test Cases
I covered four cases for each calculation type.

- add: with positive, negative, decimal numbers and one being zero
- subtract: with positive, negative, decimal numbers and one being zero
- multiply: with positive, negative, decimal numbers and one being zero
- division: with positive, negative, decimal numbers and the second number being zero
