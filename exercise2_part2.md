The `.github` directory and a few others are displayed on top. 
The directory **checkerstubs** holds some `.astub` files which 
have something to do with overriding annotations. For me as a 
beginner this github project looks very complex and extensive.

The README is very well structured. It seems that this project 
uses Gradle als a building tool. It also includes a large table 
which illustrates various commands to test the database locally.
